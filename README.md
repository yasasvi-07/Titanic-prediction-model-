# Titanic-prediction-model-
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

Model:

The prediction model is implemented using a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its robustness and good performance on a wide range of tasks.

The model is trained using the train.csv data and evaluated using cross-validation. The best-performing model is then used to make predictions on the unseen data in the test.csv file.

Requirements:
To run the prediction model, you need the following dependencies:

>Python 3

>NumPy

>Pandas

>Scikit-learn

Hope this is helpful!!!
